# Equity Research Draft Generator
A lightweight Python tool that generates structured equity research drafts using publicly available financial data from Yahoo Finance.

This project focuses on automating data collection and structuring, allowing users to spend more time on higher-value analysis rather than manual data gathering.

## Overview
This tool takes a stock ticker (e.g. AAPL, BHP.AX) and produces a first-pass equity research report including:

Market snapshot (price, market cap, valuation metrics)
Business description and segmentation
Revenue and margin data
Structured commentary to guide further analysis

It also includes optional interactive charts via a simple Streamlit interface.

# Features
Ticker-based report generation using yfinance
Clean, structured Markdown output
Interactive UI built with Streamlit
Optional charts:
Price history
Volume history
Revenue trend (where available)
Adjustable time horizons (1 month → max history)
Dark/light mode toggle with custom styling
Tech Stack
Python
Streamlit
yfinance
matplotlib
How It Works
User inputs a ticker symbol
The app fetches financial and company data from Yahoo Finance
Data is processed and formatted into a structured research template
Charts are optionally generated
A Markdown report is produced and can be downloaded

The system is intentionally rule-based (no LLM usage) to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Example Output

The tool generates a structured equity research draft in Markdown format, including:

Key financial metrics
Valuation commentary
Business overview
Supporting charts (if selected)
Limitations
Relies on Yahoo Finance → some tickers have incomplete data
Revenue data is not consistently available for all markets (e.g. some ASX stocks)
No forward-looking analysis or valuation modeling
Designed as a workflow tool, not a full research platform
Purpose

This project was built to:

Automate repetitive parts of equity research workflows
Improve efficiency in gathering and structuring financial data
Demonstrate practical use of Python and AI-assisted development (“vibe coding”)
Future Improvements (Optional)
Peer comparison module
Export to PDF
Basic valuation models (DCF / multiples)
Caching for faster repeated queries
